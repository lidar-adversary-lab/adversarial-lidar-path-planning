# Adversarial LiDAR Path Planning (Robotics)

This repository contains code and experiments for adversarial attacks and defenses on **LiDAR-based learned path planning** in a gridworld robotics simulator. We evaluate **white-box PGD** attacks, **black-box transfer** attacks, and layered defenses including **adversarial training**, **temporal modeling (LSTM)**, and a runtime defense: **Ensemble Disagreement Detection (EDD)** with **A\*** fallback.
